# Housekeeper

A web application that can store and display historical data on energy consumption of real estates.

## Installation and usage

Install the latest versions of _Node.js_ (together with _npm_ or _Yarn_) on your system. Issue the following command.

    yarn install

Take a look at the `config.json` file. Specify the path where you would like to store the database. After that you can start the server by executing the `yarn start` command. Visit the `/install` URL first and add the categories you would like to use, separated by a comma with the unit of measurement in paranthesis after each. Note that currently exactly 3 categories are supported.

## Development environment

  * Visual Studio Code 1.19.3
